<h1 align="center">Mask Detection</h1>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts. In the project, you can test whether the person is wearing mask. You can test on live camera, from images, from videos or from your android phone's camera. For using your phone's camera, your phone and computer must be connected to the same network. I used 2000 images for masked and 2000 for unmasked. I got almost 1 accuracy, soo I am not sure this is the good way of training :) I didn't add the model I trained and my imagelist folder because you will already collect your own dataset and train your own model but if you want, I can send if you contact me. I explained everything in the comment lines, if you have any questions feel free to ask. </h4>
