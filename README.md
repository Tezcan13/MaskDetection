<h1 align="center">Mask Detection</h1>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts. In the project, you can test whether the person is wear mask. You can test on live camera, from images, from videos or from your android phone's camera. I used 2000 images for mask and 2000 for without mask. I got almost 1 accuracy, soo I am not sure this is the good way of training :) </h4>
